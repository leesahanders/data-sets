## Caves 

NASA Planetary Pits and Caves dataset: <https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/dataset/caves/> 

Underwater caves sonar and vision data set: <https://cirs.udg.edu/caves-dataset/>
About it: "We provide a data set collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) testbed in the unstructured environment of an underwater cave complex. The vehicle is equipped with two mechanically scanned imaging sonar (MSIS) to simultaneously map the caves’ horizontal and vertical surfaces, a Doppler velocity log (DVL), two inertial measurement units (IMUs), depth sensor, and a vertically mounted camera imaging the sea-floor for ground truth validation in specific points. Here we present data using this testbed that was collected while guided by a diver, due to caves’ spatial complexity, during July 2013. For ease of use the original ROS bag files are provided accompanied with a derivative version combining imagery and human-readable text files for processing on other environments."

Cave and Karst GIS Data: <https://www.landscapepartnership.org/research/applcc-funded-projects/classification-and-mapping-of-cave-and-karst-resources/cave-and-karst-gis-data>
About it: These GIS data represent the input and results of a spatial statistical model used to examine the hypothesis that the presence of major faunal groups of cave obligate species could be predicted based on features of the Earth surface.
